    <p>
    For all the times that you rained on my parade<br>
    And all the clubs you get in using my name<br>
    You think you broke my heart, oh, girl, for goodness' sake<br>
    You think I'm crying on my own, well, I ain't<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And I didn't wanna write a song<br>
    'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but<br>
    You still hit my phone up<br>
    And baby, I'll be movin' on<br>
    And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back<br>
    Maybe you should know that<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br>
    And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br>
    And I've been so caught up in my job<br>
    Didn't see what's going on, but now I know<br>
    I'm better sleeping on my own<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
    Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself<br>
    And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>
    You should go and love yourself<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    But when you told me that you hated my friends<br>
    The only problem was with you and not them<br>
    And every time you told me my opinion was wrong<br>
    And tried to make me forget where I came from<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And I didn't wanna write a song<br>
    'Cause I didn't want anyone thinkin' I still care, I don't, but<br>
    You still hit my phone up<br>
    And baby, I'll be movin' on<br>
    And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back<br>
    Maybe you should know that<br>
    </p>

    You should go and love yourself<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    For all the times that you made me feel small<br>
    I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all<br>
    I never felt so low and I was vulnerable<br>
    Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
    Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself<br>
    And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>
    You should go and love yourself<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
    Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself (yeah)<br>
    And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm)<br>
    Still holdin' on to somethin' (holdin' on, no)<br>
    You should go and love yourself<br>
    </p>
